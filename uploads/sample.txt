Australia pacer Mitchell Starc heaped praise on India batter Yashasvi Jaiswal for his marathon knock in the second innings in his first red-ball match Down Under.

"He's not in his first game, so there's obviously been a bit of hype around him, and he's certainly very skilful. I think we saw that over the second innings this week. He's a huge talent in India, and he's going to play a lot of cricket for them. It was nice to get him cheaply in the first innings, but he certainly made amends in the second," Starc said.
