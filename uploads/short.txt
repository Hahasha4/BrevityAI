Global cooperation is critical in the fight against climate change. International agreements like the Paris Accord aim to bring countries together to set targets for reducing emissions and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Governments, businesses, and individuals all have a role to play. Simple actions, such as reducing energy consumption, minimizing waste, and supporting eco-friendly products, can collectively make a significant impact.
